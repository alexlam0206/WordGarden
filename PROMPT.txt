I am building an iOS app called WordGarden in SwiftUI. It is a vocabulary learning app where each word is a plant. 
DO NOT DELETE PROMPT.txt
Features:
- Main screen shows a scrollable list of words (plants). Each plant shows its growth stage with an emoji or image.
- Tap a plant to view details: word, meaning, example sentence, and hear pronunciation.
- Users can add new words with a form (fields: word, meaning, example sentence).
- Words grow when reviewed daily; missed reviews cause plants to wilt.
- Users can tap a "water" button to grow the plant.
- Animate plants growing (scale or emoji changes).
- Save all words, growth stages, and review info locally so progress persists across app launches.
- Optional: small animation effect when watering.

Please generate SwiftUI code that:
1. Defines the data model for plants and words.
2. Builds the main list of plants with growth stages.
3. Adds a form to create new words.
4. Implements growth/wilt logic.
5. Implements saving and loading data locally.
6. Includes basic animations for growth.

Please include clear comments explaining the code so I can understand it as a beginner learning SwiftUI.


Explain the code as comments so I can understand and learn from it.
I will compile by myself.

NO NEED TO REMARK Created by XXX for each file.

1 Layout

Full-screen vertical layout (VStack)

Background: soft gradient (e.g., light green → soft yellow) to feel like a garden sunrise.

Top: App logo or plant emoji 🌱

Middle: Illustrations or simple animated icons showing:

Seed planted → Word added

Watering → Growth

Daily review → Plant grows

Forgotten → Plant wilts

Text captions under each illustration: short, friendly, beginner-friendly sentences

2 Buttons

Skip (top-right corner) → go straight to main app

Next / Continue (bottom) → move through onboarding pages

Optional “Get Started” on the last page → enter the app

3 Page Structure (3–4 pages)

Welcome Page

Emoji or small plant icon

Text: “Welcome to WordGarden! 🌱 Learn words by growing your garden.”

Add Words Page

Illustration of seed being planted

Text: “Add new words to plant seeds in your garden.”

Grow Plants Page

Illustration of watering or growth

Text: “Review words daily to help your plants grow strong!”

Keep Growing Page (optional)

Wilted vs healthy plants illustration

Text: “Don’t forget to review—otherwise your plants might wilt!”

4 Visual Style / Animation Ideas

Simple animations:

Fade in text/images

Scale plants slightly when moving to next page

Colors: soft, earthy tones (greens, yellows, browns)

Fonts: rounded, friendly, readable (e.g., Inter or SF Rounded)

Swipe gesture support to move between pages

5️ SwiftUI Notes

Use TabView with .tabViewStyle(.page) for paging effect.

Use @State to track current page.

Buttons trigger page change or completion.

API

I am building an iOS app called WordGarden using SwiftUI. It is a vocabulary learning app where each word is represented as a plant. 

I want to use the Free Dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) to fetch:
- Definitions
- Example sentences
- Pronunciation (optional)

Requirements:
1. SwiftUI code that fetches a word's definition and example from the Free Dictionary API.
2. Display the word, its definition, and example in a WordDetailView.
3. Handle loading and errors gracefully (show a spinner while loading, show message if not found).
4. Integrate this WordDetailView with the main plant list, so tapping a plant opens the details view.
5. Keep the code beginner-friendly with clear comments explaining each part.
6. Use async/await for network calls (modern Swift).
7. Optional: button to play pronunciation using AVSpeechSynthesizer.

Please generate the full SwiftUI code for this feature, including the model structs for decoding the API response.


Please generate full Swift/SwiftUI code for the service + model + view described above, with explanatory comments. Also include a brief usage example of how to integrate `WordDetailView` into a list of plants.

Finally, mention any API‑usage considerations (rate limits, caching responses, offline fallback) that I should keep in mind for WordGarden.
