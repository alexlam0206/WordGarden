Plan
🌱 WordGarden — Final App Plan (2026 Swift Student Challenge)
💡 Concept

Learn vocabulary like growing a garden.
Each word is a seed — reviewing, pronouncing, and focusing makes it grow.
Too much screen time or distraction? The plant wilts 🌿💧

🧩 Core Features
1. Word Growth System

Words grow from seed → sprout → leaf → flower as user reviews.

Each review increases “growth level”.

Forgetting or not using words causes wilting.

Local animation (SwiftUI Lottie-like hand-drawn growth transitions).

2. Local Storage + backup cloud sync

All user data stored via UserDefaults and serialized JSON.

Uses CacheManager for definitions.

Can export encrypted backup file.

cloud sync by default.

3. Screen Time Integration 

Reads iOS Screen Time stats (or approximate via app open time).

If too high, tree wilts or slows growth.

Promotes focus and learning balance.

4. AI Assistant for Words 

Goal: Help the user learn more naturally with on-device or cloud AI.

Options:

Local AI (Offline): Use a small Core ML model for simple word explanations or grammar corrections.

Google Gemini or OpenAI API (Optional):

Let users bring their own API key (via settings).

Features:

Generate example sentences.

Translate word into user’s native language.

Suggest related vocabulary (“If you learn ‘plant’, also learn ‘seed’, ‘grow’, ‘root’…”).

Daily AI quiz: “Explain this word in your own words.”

💡 Gemini is great because of multimodal capability — later you can let users snap a photo and AI identifies the object → generates vocab word!

5. Firebase Integration

user logs in with Google:

Sync data securely using Firebase Firestore.

Backup trees, words, and progress.

Store AI-generated examples (if desired).

Optional global leaderboard: “Most Trees Grown 🌳”

Firebase also helps with:

Cloud backup

Push notifications for review reminders

⚙️ Implementation: Store minimal JSON per user
/users/{uid}/data → { words: […], tree: {...}, stats: {...} }

6. Focus Mode (Optional Add-On ✈️)

“Focus Garden” → blocks distractions while studying.

UI: peaceful background with soft wind & ambient nature sounds.

“Focus View” can use a treehouse or garden window animation (like airplane window from Focus Flight).

If user leaves app early → flower droops.

If completes focus session → flower blooms.

7. Daily Word & Review Notifications

Scheduled local notifications using UNUserNotificationCenter.

Firebase Cloud Messaging (optional for logged-in users).

Can include AI-generated quote or sentence of the day.

8. Custom API Integration

In Settings, user can enter:

Gemini API key

OpenAI API key

Allows advanced users to unlock richer AI content without backend cost.

🧠 AI Prompts Examples
✨ Word Meaning

“Explain the word ‘serendipity’ in a fun and simple way for a 13-year-old learner.”

📸 Photo Learning

“You took a photo of [object]. Identify what it is, then teach one English word related to it with pronunciation and example sentence.”

🌿 Motivation

“Write a short encouraging sentence as if you’re a talking plant that helps a learner grow.”
